                In this event, a team of three members is given a virtual amount of 100 million dollars. A slide is then showed to the teams which consists of information about a particular player. The slide consists of various attributes about a player. Every player is assigned a base price and a rating.  If a team is interested to buy a player, a bid is placed. The bid keeps on increasing, if other teams also bid for the same player.  In the end, the player is sold to the highest bidder. The goal of the event is to assemble a team of 7 players consisting of 1 goal keeper, 3 defenders, 2 midfielders and 1 attacker.  Failing to achieve such formation results in disqualification. In the end, the team with the least budget spent and highest overall rating of the assembled team is declared the winner. The purpose of this event is to enhance the financial management skills of students and make them meticulous at planning.<br><br>
